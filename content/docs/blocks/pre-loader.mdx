import PreLoader from "@/components/zenblocks/pre-loader";
import { Preview } from "@/components/mdx/preview";

## Overview

The **PreLoader** is a GSAP-powered loading overlay designed to create a strong,
intentional first impression while your application initializes.

It combines **entrance and exit animations**, an **animated percentage counter**,
and a controlled fade-out to ensure the main UI is revealed only after the loading
sequence completes.

---

## Features

- 🎬 Entrance and exit animations powered by GSAP
- 🔢 Animated percentage counter (0 → 100)
- 🌀 Scale- and rotation-based motion staging
- 🧠 Minimal API with `onComplete` callback
- ⚡ Optimized for Next.js App Router
- 🛠️ Preview-safe rendering via `embedded` mode

---

## Preview

The preview uses **embedded mode** so the loader stays inside the preview frame
instead of taking over the entire page.

<Preview link="pre-loader">
  <div className="relative h-96 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg">
    <PreLoader embedded />
  </div>
</Preview>

---

## Installation

Install the component using the **ZenBlocks CLI** (recommended):

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/pre-loader.json
```

This will:

- Copy the `PreLoader` component into your project
- Install required dependencies automatically

---

## Manual dependencies

If installing manually, ensure the following packages are installed:

```bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react
```

---

## Usage

### Basic usage (fullscreen)

By default, the PreLoader renders as a **full-screen overlay**.

```tsx
import PreLoader from "@/components/zenblocks/pre-loader";

export default function Page() {
  return <PreLoader />;
}
```

---

### Running logic after load

Use the `onComplete` callback to run logic after the exit animation finishes:

```tsx
<PreLoader onComplete={() => setReady(true)} />
```

---

### Embedded / preview usage

When rendering inside documentation, previews, or constrained containers, enable
`embedded` mode:

```tsx
<PreLoader embedded />
```

This switches positioning from `fixed` → `absolute`, keeping the loader scoped to
its parent container.

---

## API

### Props

| Prop       | Type         | Default | Description                                              |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| onComplete | `() => void` | —       | Called after the exit animation completes                |
| embedded   | `boolean`    | `false` | Renders inside a container instead of fullscreen overlay |

---

## Notes

- Fullscreen mode uses `fixed inset-0`
- Embedded mode uses `absolute inset-0`
- `pointer-events-none` prevents interaction blocking post-exit
- GSAP easing, durations, and animation order are fully customizable
- Custom fonts are optional and easily replaceable

---

## Philosophy

ZenBlocks components follow an **ownership-first** approach:

- You install the source code
- You control the animations
- You decide how it behaves in production and previews

No wrappers. No lock-in. Just clean, production-ready UI.
