## Installation

Install the component using the **ZenBlocks CLI** (recommended):

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

This will:

- Copy the Navbar component into your project
- Install required dependencies automatically

---

## Manual dependencies

If you are installing manually, make sure the following packages are installed:

```bash
npm install framer-motion lucide-react next-themes
```

---

## Usage

Import the component directly from your codebase:

```tsx
import Navbar from "@/components/zenblocks/navbar";

export default function Page() {
  return <Navbar />;
}
```

The component is fully editable and intended to be customized to fit your
design system.

### Props

## Notes

- Designed as a **single-file component** for easy ownership and customization
- No runtime lock-in or external abstractions
- Safe to modify animations, layout, and styles directly

---

## Philosophy

ZenBlocks components follow an **ownership-first** approach:

- You install the code
- You control the implementation
- You ship without constraints
