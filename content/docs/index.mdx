import { Tabs, Tab } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

## Overview

**ZenBlocks** is a collection of sophisticated, physics-enabled UI components designed to vary from utility-first primitives to complex, interactive blocks.

It is **not** a traditional dependency-based library. Instead, it leverages the **shadcn/ui CLI** to distribute code directly into your project.

### Why ZenBlocks?

-   **Ownership First**: Code is scaffolded into your `components/zenblocks` directory. You own it, you modify it.
-   **Zero Runtime Lock-in**: Remove or refactor any part of the library without breaking external dependencies.
-   **Modern Stack**: Built for **Tailwind CSS v4** and **React Server Components** by default.
-   **Motion Centric**: Deep integrations with `framer-motion` and `gsap` for premium interactions.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Ensure your project is set up with the following:

-   **React 18+** or **Next.js 14+** (App Router recommended)
-   **Tailwind CSS v4** (or v3 with appropriate config)
-   **shadcn/ui** initialized in your project

---

## 2. Initialize Utils

Some ZenBlocks components rely on a shared set of utilities (like `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` wrappers).
Run this command **once** to set up the necessary infrastructure.

<Tabs items={["npx", "pnpm", "bun"]}>

```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/utils.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/utils.json
```

```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/utils.json
```

</Tabs>

---

## 3. Install Components

Components can be installed individually using the CLI. This automatically handles dependencies and file placement.

### Example: Installing the Navbar

<Tabs items={["npx", "pnpm", "bun"]}>

```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

</Tabs>

Just like that, `Navbar.tsx` is now part of your codebase in `components/zenblocks/`.

---

## 4. Usage

Import standard components directly from your components folder:

```tsx
import Navbar from "@/components/zenblocks/navbar";

export default function Layout() {
  return <Navbar />;
}
```

---

## 5. Advanced Configuration

### Monorepo Support

If you are working inside a monorepo, use the `-c` flag to specify your workspace path.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json -c ./apps/web
```

### Custom Directories

ZenBlocks respects your `components.json` configuration. If you have customized your alias or component paths, the CLI will adapt automatically.

---

## Philosophy

### The "Copy-Paste" Era

We believe the best abstraction for UI is **no abstraction**.

By distributing source code instead of compiled npm packages, ZenBlocks eliminates the "black box" problem. You never have to fight the library to change a transition duration, swap a color, or add a new prop.

1.  **Install** the robust default.
2.  **Adapt** it to your brand.
3.  **Ship** with confidence.
