import { Tabs, Tab } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs";

## Overview

ZenBlocks is a **copy-paste friendly, CLI-powered UI library** built on top of:

- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **shadcn/ui**

All components are installed **directly into your codebase**, giving you:

- Full ownership of the code
- Zero runtime lock-in
- Complete styling control

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing ZenBlocks components, ensure your project includes:

- **Tailwind CSS v4**  
  https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nextjs
- A working **React or Next.js** setup

---

## 2. Install shared utilities

Some ZenBlocks components rely on shared utilities such as the `cn` helper.  
You only need to install these **once per project**.

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>

```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/utils.json
```

```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/utils.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/utils.json
```

</Tabs>

---

## 3. Install a component

Each ZenBlocks component can be installed individually using the
**shadcn/ui CLI**.

Example: installing the **Navbar** component.

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>

```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

</Tabs>

The CLI will automatically:

- Copy the component into your project
- Install required `shadcn/ui` primitives
- Install external dependencies when needed

> While a copy button is available, **using the CLI is strongly recommended**
> to ensure all dependencies and files are correctly installed.

---

## 4. Use the component

Once installed, import the component directly from your codebase.

```tsx
import Navbar from "@/components/zenblocks/navbar";

export default function Page() {
  return <Navbar />;
}
```

---

## 5. Blocks (multi-file components)

**Blocks** are higher-level, feature-complete UI sections composed of
multiple components and utilities.

Because they include multiple files, **Blocks must be installed using the CLI**.

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>

```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

</Tabs>

---

## 6. Optional dependencies

Some components rely on additional third-party libraries
(such as `framer-motion` or `next-themes`).

These dependencies are listed at the **bottom of each component’s documentation**.

---

## 7. Monorepo support

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>

```bash tab="bun"
bunx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json -c ./apps/www
```

```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json -c ./apps/www
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json -c ./apps/www
```

</Tabs>

## Philosophy

ZenBlocks follows an **ownership-first** approach:

- No hidden abstractions
- No locked-in styles
- No runtime dependencies

You install the code.  
You control it.  
You ship it.
