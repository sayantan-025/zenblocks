## 🎯 Overview

**ZenBlocks** is a collection of sophisticated, physics-enabled UI components designed to vary from utility-first primitives to complex, interactive blocks. Unlike traditional npm packages, ZenBlocks leverages the **shadcn/ui CLI** to distribute code directly into your project, giving you complete ownership and control.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔓 Ownership First**: Code is scaffolded into your `components/zenblocks` directory. You own it, you modify it.
- **🚀 Zero Runtime Lock-in**: Remove or refactor any part of the library without breaking external dependencies.
- **⚡ Modern Stack**: Built for **Tailwind CSS v4** and **React Server Components** by default.
- **🎨 Motion Centric**: Deep integrations with `framer-motion` and `gsap` for premium interactions.
- **📱 Fully Responsive**: All components are designed to work seamlessly across all device sizes.
- **🌗 Theme Support**: Built-in dark mode support using `next-themes`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Ensure your project has:

- **React 18+** or **Next.js 14+** (App Router recommended)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (or v3 with appropriate config)
- **shadcn/ui** initialized in your project

### Installation

#### 1. Initialize shadcn/ui

ZenBlocks is built on top of shadcn/ui. Ensure it is initialized in your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

#### 2. Initialize Utils

Some ZenBlocks components rely on shared utilities. Run this command **once**:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/utils.json
```

#### 3. Install Components

Install components individually using the CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://zenblocks-three.vercel.app/r/navbar.json
```

Replace `navbar` with any component name from the list above (in kebab-case).

#### 3. Use in Your Project

```tsx
import Navbar from "@/components/zenblocks/navbar";

export default function Layout() {
  return <Navbar />;
}
```
